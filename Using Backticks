I just also learned about;
```
BACKTICCKS
```

#### Backticks are super useful in markdown and coding!

1. Inline code formatting
markdownUse the `lambda:GetFunction` action for this.
Install `python3` on your system.
The file is called `config.json`.

2. Code blocks (triple backticks)
markdown```
This is a code block
Multiple lines
Preserves formatting
```

3. Code blocks with syntax highlighting
markdown```python
def hello():
    print("Hello World")
```
```json
{
    "name": "example"
}
```

4. In programming (JavaScript, shell scripts)
javascriptlet name = `Hello ${firstName}`; // Template literals
Where you'll use them:

GitHub README files - formatting code/filenames
Documentation - showing commands or technical terms
Slack/Discord - highlighting code snippets
Blog posts - technical writing
Comments - making things stand out

Quick guide:

Single backtick ` = inline code
Triple backticks ``` = code block

Now you know a key markdown formatting tool! Very handy for technical documentation and your portfolio.
