# AWS Cloud Practice & Policy Portfolio

This repository documents my journey toward becoming an AWS Solutions Architect and AI specialist. It contains practical AWS implementations, policies, and solutions I've built while mastering cloud architecture and security.

## Current Focus: IAM & Security Foundations

As I work toward AWS Solutions Architect certification, I'm building a strong foundation in identity and access management.

### IAM Policies

#### HR User Management Policy

**Purpose:** Basic user account management for HR team

**Use Case:** New employee onboarding, password resets, user group management

**Security Considerations:** Prevents user deletion and policy modification to maintain security boundaries

**File:** `HR-User-Management.json`

**Key Permissions:**
- Create new IAM users
- Add users to existing groups  
- Reset user passwords
- View user and group information
- Explicitly denies user deletion and policy creation
