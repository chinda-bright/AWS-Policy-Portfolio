#### EC2 Learning Log: Public IP Address Changes

### What I Observed
When I stop and start my EC2 instance, the public IPv4 address changes.

### Why This Happens
When instance is STOPPED:

-------------------------------------------

AWS releases the public IP back to their pool
IP becomes available for other customers

When instance is STARTED:

AWS assigns a new random public IP
Cannot keep the same IP with stop/start cycle


Why AWS Does This

Efficient use of limited IPv4 addresses
Public IPs are scarce and valuable
Only running instances need them


Solutions
1. Elastic IP

Reserve a permanent public IP address
Stays the same across stop/start
Free while attached to running instance
Costs money if reserved but NOT attached

2. Use Private IP

Internal AWS communication only
Never changes
Not accessible from internet

3. DNS Mapping

Point domain name to current IP
Update DNS when IP changes


For Learning Phase
Accept the changing IP - this is normal EC2 behavior.
Use Elastic IP only when you need a permanent public address.

Key Takeaway
STOP/START = New Public IP (by design)
REBOOT = Same Public IP (instance never fully stops)
